# Database Hash File Implementation

# Introduction:
This project was developed as part of the university course "Implementation of Database Systems."
 The aim of this project is to implement two files related to a database: a primary hash file and a secondary hash file. These files serve as index structures for database records, facilitating efficient retrieval based on different keys.

# Development Environment:
- Windows.
- Linux.

# Development Platform:
- CLion IDE.

# Compilation:
To compile the project, execute the following commands:

- make sht: Creates the ./build/sht_main executable for testing primary and secondary hash files functionality.
- make st: Creates the ./build/st_main executable for printing statistics of primary and secondary hash files.
